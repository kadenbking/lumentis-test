y = x\tan(\theta) - \frac{1}{2}\frac{g}{v_0^2\cos^2(\theta)}x^2

The equation above represents the trajectory of a baseball hit with an initial velocity $v_0$ at an angle $\theta$ above the horizontal, taking into account the effects of gravity ($g$).

### Step 3: The Landing

As the ball sailed over the outfield wall, the crowd erupted in a deafening roar of euphoria. In that moment, Groot had achieved the ultimate feat – a game-winning home run that would forever etch his name in baseball lore.
