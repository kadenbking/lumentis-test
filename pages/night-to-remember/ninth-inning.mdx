As he stepped up to the plate, the unmistakable sound of his cleats echoed through the stadium, a rhythmic prelude to the drama that was about to unfold. The opposing pitcher, a formidable adversary in his own right, stared him down from the mound, their gazes locked in a silent battle of wills.

The first pitch whistled past, a blur of white against the backdrop of the night sky. Groot remained unfazed, his focus unwavering, his grip on the bat steady and sure. The second pitch followed, a tantalizing curveball that danced just outside the strike zone, tempting him to chase a futile swing.

But Groot was a master of discipline, his patience honed by countless hours of practice and experience. He watched the pitch sail by, his eyes tracking its every movement, his mind calculating the perfect moment to strike.

The equation above represents the final velocity of a batted ball, where $v_0$ is the initial velocity of the pitch, $a$ is the acceleration imparted by the swing, and $d$ is the distance the ball travels from the point of contact to the sweet spot of the bat.
